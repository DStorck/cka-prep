# [updating a deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment)

### create a deployment running nginx version 1.12.2 that will run in 2 pods
 1. Scale this to 4 pods.
 2. Scale it back to 2 pods.
 3. Upgrade this to 1.13.8 and record the update
 4. rollback to previous version
 5. show the rollout history


create the deployment   
`kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:1.12.2 --replicas=2`

scale it up    
`kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4 --record `

scale it back to 2     
`kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=2 --record `

upgrade to 1.13.8     
`kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.13.8 --record`

rollback to previous version     
`kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx --record`

check rollout history        
`kubectl rollout history deployment nginx`


### create a daemonset. change the update strategy to do a rolling update but delay each pod update by 30 seconds

To set a daemonset to use the rolling update strategy, you need to configure the update strategy using the `spec.updateStrategy.type` field - set it to have the value RollingUpdate.  Then any change to `spec.template` or subfields will trigger the update. To affect the wait time between pod updates, change the `spec.minReadySeconds`, which determines how long a Pod must be “ready” before the rolling update proceeds to upgrade subsequent pods
